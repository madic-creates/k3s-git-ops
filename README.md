## ðŸŒŽ Overview

This repository is a playground for my Kubernetes Home Cluster.

It uses [ArgoCD](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd) as a GitOPs platform to automate the deployment and keep the cluster in a consistent state.

For more information take a lookt at my [docs](https://madic-creates.github.io/k3s-git-ops/).

If you're getting a certificate error when opening the docs (happens in Firefox), thats because of the hyphen in my username. Hyphens aren't allowed at the end of DNS names. As a workaround you can use a chromium based browser.

See also the following GitHub discussion: [Hyphen at the end of usernames](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/143105)
